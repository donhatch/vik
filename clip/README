OpenJSCAD.org notes

- Most instructions are either in the main README.md
  or in the wiki book (but some things are still not obvious).

- The global functions intersection,difference give colors;
  the member functions intersect,subtract do not.

Q: how to develop the openjscad command?
A: Do the following:
     npm install
     npm link
   Then changes made to .js files it uses will be visible when running openjscad.
   If changes are in some other module like csg, then follow specific instructions
   for that in README.md.

Q: how to develop the main ui page?
A: changes are generally reflected in the web server:
       npm run start-dev   # starts it on port 8080
   or, slower:
       npm run build-web
       python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8002   # or whatever
   (I don't know what build-opt is-- "with options"? I don't know what that means.)

=======================================
Isolating the clip, first attempt:
  - started with:
      2x2x2x2Unit-03.00.stl.zip
    unzipped it into:
      2x2x2x2Unit-03.00.stl
  - dragged-and-dropped it to openjscad.org ui,
    copy-pasted the jscad stuff from the RHS of the ui into a file:
      2x2x2x2Unit-03.00.stl.jscad
  - I didn't understand that openjscad.org was a different website from the one I was using,
    so added a "polyhedron" shim:
      2x2x2x2Unit-03.00.stl.jscad.tweaked.jscad
  - and then added further statements to extract just the clip:
      2x2x2x2Unit-03.00.stl.jscad.tweaked.clipOnly.jscad
  - fed that back into the ui, saved to:
      2x2x2x2Unit-03.00.clipOnly.stl
    also copy-pasted the LHS,
    added "polyhedron" shim,
    and fixed orientations (!?), to produce:
      2x2x2x2Unit-03.00.clipOnly.stl.jscad

I think I should be able to do it simpler, now that I understand openjscad.org is
a different, enhanced, repo.
Can I do it via the command line?

After filing & getting fixed:
  https://github.com/jscad/OpenJSCAD.org/issues/308
  https://github.com/jscad/OpenJSCAD.org/issues/309
  https://github.com/jscad/OpenJSCAD.org/issues/310
I can now isolate the clip from the command line:
  openjscad 2x2x2x2Unit-03.00.stl -o 2x2x2x2Unit-03.00.stl.jscad
  cp 2x2x2x2Unit-03.00.stl.jscad 2x2x2x2Unit-03.00.stl.tweakedToDoClipOnly.jscad
  ... added statements to extract just the clip ...
  openjscad 2x2x2x2Unit-03.00.stl.tweakedToDoClipOnly.jscad -o 2x2x2x2Unit-03.00.clipOnly.stl -of stla
(and it's bad already-- some tri orientations backwards)
  openjscad 2x2x2x2Unit-03.00.clipOnly.stl -o 2x2x2x2Unit-03.00.clipOnly.stl.jscad
But some of the triangles are backwards!!!  Need to file bug.
In the meantime, fix orientations...
  cp 2x2x2x2Unit-03.00.clipOnly.stl.jscad 2x2x2x2Unit-03.00.clipOnly.stl.jscad.orientationsFixed.jscad
  ... added statements to merge dup verts, then to make polygons coherent ...
That looks good in the ui.
  openjscad 2x2x2x2Unit-03.00.clipOnly.stl.jscad.orientationsFixed.jscad -o 2x2x2x2Unit-03.00.clipOnly.stl.jscad.orientationsFixed.jscad.stl -of stla
ARGH!  So just converting to stl makes it look crappy, again, in the ui???  Wtf?
So that means any time I want to do any operations on it, I have to start by fixing it???
File bug!
  cp 2x2x2x2Unit-03.00.clipOnly.stl.jscad.orientationsFixed.jscad.stl 2x2x2x2Unit-03.00.clipOnly.stl.jscad.orientationsFixed.jscad.stl.jscad

TODO: make a utility that takes an stl file and fixes the orientations, and spits it back out.  Maybe?
  Call it stlfix.
  or, just hack up the existing output function in openjscad?  not sure.

  Actually, simplest way would be to write some python, that takes stla and produces stla.
  (Actually made it to take stl binary or ascii).
  stlFixTriangleOrientations.py

ARGH! It's not coming out incoherent?
So what went wrong?  Was it the stl reader?
Q: are the normals ok?
PA: no. if I'm looking at it correctly, some are sideways (even on triangles that aren't degenerate), and there are some degenerate trianges, too.
So, make it fix the normals, as best it can.
  ./stlFixTriangleOrientations.py < 2x2x2x2Unit-03.00.clipOnly.stl > 2x2x2x2Unit-03.00.clipOnly.normalsFixed.stl

Ok, I think I do best if I grab it from the original stl before converting to jscad
(the conversion to jscad is actually fine, but the conversion back out to stl adds weirdness!)
So, wrote stlClipTopOnly.py.
  ./stlClipTopOnly.py 2 < 2x2x2x2Unit-03.00.stl > 2x2x2x2Unit-03.00.stl.clipTopOnly.stl
  openjscad 2x2x2x2Unit-03.00.stl.clipTopOnly.stl -o 2x2x2x2Unit-03.00.stl.clipTopOnly.stl.jscad
  cp 2x2x2x2Unit-03.00.stl.clipTopOnly.stl.jscad 2x2x2x2Unit-03.00.stl.clipTopOnly.stl.jscad.extruded.jscad
  ... edited it to add extrusion ...


Q: what's the best way of viewing a damn stl file?
   inadequate method #1: just view it
        fine but the problem (reversed faces) doesn't happen,
        and I can't do further processing on it
        like I need to.
   inadequate method #1: convert to openjscad and view that
        problem with that is, the conversion is lossy.
        viewing the result has bad tris, even though viewing the STL
        doesn't have bad tris.

Q: can I get OpenJSCad.org ui to show wireframe?

Q: omg what is all this CRAP in min.html,options.html,min.css,opt.css,min.js,...
   I have NO FUCKING IDEA how I'm supposed to work a viewer,
   other than by hacking up source code and having very little effect.
   This is a completely rotten development environment :-(


OH OH OH!  there are instructions in README.md!!!
Deserialization isn't currently documented well, but there's an example here.

  Ok let's start again.
  Write some utility programs:
    isolateClip.js -- got it!
    randomlyColorize.js -- note that this prevents too-fine reteselletion in subsequent operations for some reason??
    center.js
  with some helpers:
    getCommonArgs.js
    getCompilable.js
